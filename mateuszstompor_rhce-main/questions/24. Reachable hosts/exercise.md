# 24. Reachable hosts

Aim of this task is to write a dynamic inventory script that returns a given host only if it is reachable. 
The idea is to avoid attempts of interacting with a server that is shut off. 
Use script from 15th exercise as the base for development. 
Store the script at `/home/automation/plays/scripts/reachable_hosts`. 
You can use `ssh` or `ping` command to verify that a host responds.
Meet the same requirements in terms of defined hosts' variables as in 15th exercise
